#My personal alarm clock
I'm always stressed before going to bed because I don't trust my iPhone alarm clock. It has failed me on several occasions, before big events
such as a test. I want to be 100% sure to be awoken before going to bed. That is why I decided to take on the personal project of creating my own
alarm clock that will wake me up with complete certainty.

I'm coding this app using Swift 3.0 and XCode 8.

##Main features 
* A test button that tests your alarm will work. 
* Wake up with solving a math equation
* Simple and beautiful interface
